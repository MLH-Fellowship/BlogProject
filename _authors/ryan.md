I am currently enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.
When I was in the United States Coast Guard, I was lucky to be able to train and supervise multiple young professionals.
I worked to diagnose and repair the onboard mechanical and electrical equipment.
I also derived new more efficient methods to accomplish routine tasks.
I gained experience in leadership, communications, and problem solving.
I am looking to start a career in the Cybersecurity field.
